Experiment 2

Aim: To interface an LED/Buzzer with Arduino/Raspberry Pi and write a program to turn ON the LED for 1
second after every 2 seconds.

Requirements:
1. Standard 5mm LED
2. One Resistor
3. Arduino Uno microcontroller board (ATmega328p)
4. Jumper wires

Procedure:
Step 1: Open your browser and visit www.wokwi.com. Select the "Arduino Uno" microcontroller for the
simulation.
Step 2: In the simulation interface, click on the "+" symbol to add the components listed in the requirements
above.
Step 3: Using jumper wires, connect the Anode (A-pin) of the LED to digital pin 3 on the Arduino
microcontroller.
• Connect a resistor between the Anode and the Arduino pin to limit the current.
• Connect the Cathode (C-pin) of the LED to ground (GND).
Step 4: Write the following program in "sketch.ino".

void setup() {
 // Setup code here, to run once:
 pinMode(3, OUTPUT); // Set digital pin 3 as an OUTPUT pin
}
void loop() {
 // Main code here, to run repeatedly:
 digitalWrite(3, HIGH); // Turn the LED ON (can also use digitalWrite(3, 1))
 delay(1000); // Wait for 1 second
 digitalWrite(3, LOW); // Turn the LED OFF (can also use digitalWrite(3, 0))
 delay(1000); // Wait for 1 second
}

Output: 
LED will turn ON for 1 second after every 2 seconds by interfacing the LED with Arduino.
