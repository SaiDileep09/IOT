Experiment 8:

Aim: To interface Bluetooth with Arduino/Raspberry Pi and write a program to turn an LED ON/OFF when
'1'/'0' is received from a smartphone using Bluetooth.

Steps:
Step 1: Open MIT App Inventor in Google Chrome.
Step 2: Click on the "Create Apps!" button.
Step 3: Click on the "Blocks" button.
• a)
o Click on "ListPicker1" and select "when ListPicker1.AfterPicking do".
o Click on "Control" and select "if then".
o Click on "BluetoothClient1" and select "call BluetoothClient1.Connect address".
o Click on "ListPicker1" and select "ListPicker1.Selection".
o Click on "ListPicker1" and select "set ListPicker1.Elements to".
o Click on "BluetoothClient1" and select "BluetoothClient1.AddressesAndNames".
• b)
o Click on "ListPicker1" and select "when ListPicker1.BeforePicking do".
o Click on "ListPicker1" and select "set ListPicker1.Elements to".
o Click on "BluetoothClient1" and select "BluetoothClient1.AddressesAndNames".
• c)
o Click on "Button1" and select "when Button1.Click do".
o Click on "BluetoothClient1" and select "call BluetoothClient1.SendText text".
o Click on "Text" and select "textString". Enter "1" into the text box.
• d)
o Repeat the above steps for "Button2", but set the text to "0".
• e)
o Click on "Clock1" and select "when Clock1.Timer do".
o Click on "Control" and select "if then".
o Click on "BluetoothClient1" and select "BluetoothClient1.IsConnected".
o Click on "Label2" and select "set Label2.Text to".
o Click on "BluetoothClient1" and select "call BluetoothClient1.ReceiveText
numberOfBytes" and "call BluetoothClient1.BytesAvailableToReceive".
Step 4: Click on "Build" and in the dropdown menu, select "Android App (.apk)"
Step 5: A QR code will be generated.
Step 6: Click on the link generated by scanning the QR code on your mobile device and install the
"LED_Blink" app.
Step 7: Now, you can operate the app to turn the LED ON/OFF when '1'/'0' is received from the smartphone
via Bluetooth.
