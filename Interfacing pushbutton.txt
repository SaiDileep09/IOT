Experiment 3

Aim: To interface a pushbutton/digital sensor (IR/LDR) with Arduino/Raspberry Pi and write a program to
turn ON the LED when the push button is pressed or at sensor detection.

Requirements:
1. Standard 5mm LED
2. Two Resistors
3. Arduino Uno microcontroller board (ATmega328p)
4. Jumper wires
5. Pushbutton

Procedure:
Step 1: Open www.wokwi.com in your browser and select the "Arduino Uno" microcontroller.
Step 2: In the simulation part, select the above-listed components by clicking the "+" symbol for each of the
required components.
Step 3: Using jumper wires, connect the Anode (A-pin) of the LED to digital pin 3 of the Arduino
microcontroller through Resistor 1. Connect the Cathode (C-pin) of the LED to ground (GND).
Step 4: Provide a 5V power supply to the pushbutton's 1L pin.
Step 5: Connect the pushbuttonâ€™s 1R to both GND through Resistor 2 and digital pin 5.
Step 6: Write the following program in "sketch.ino".

int flag = 0;
void setup() {
 pinMode(3, OUTPUT);
 pinMode(5, INPUT);
}
void loop() {
 int value = digitalRead(5);
 if (value == 1 && flag == 0) {
 digitalWrite(3, HIGH);
 delay(1000);
 flag = 1;
 }
 else if (value == 1 && flag == 1) {
 digitalWrite(3, LOW);
 delay(1000);
 flag = 0;
 }
}

Output:
When the pushbutton is pressed, the LED will be turned ON by interfacing the pushbutton with Arduino.
